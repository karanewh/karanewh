## Analysis of workplace outbreaks and federal OSHA complaints during the COVID-19 pandemic

The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-caf5e31d883a18deae6cd367a5ee8978">Associated Press</a> ran the story, and it was picked up by newspapers across the country, including The Washington Post. Read the full version on the Howard Center website here.

## Newspaper lineage web scraper
<p>A colleague and I built a web scraper that uses the Library of Congress Chronicling America database to trace the lineages of all current U.S. newspapers. We wrote the code for the scraper in Python using Selenium and exported the resulting files to R for further manipulation and analysis. This scraper laid the foundation for analysis of historical newspaper coverage in a forthcoming investigative series and news app from the Howard Center for investigative Journalism.</p>


## Data-driven education reporting
<p>Prior to my graduate program, I used a data-driven approach to connect public policy to peopleâ€™s lives as an education beat reporter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>For example, as frustration over standardized testing surged nationwide, I obtained data from the state Department of Education and <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/skipping-the-tests-pennsylvania-opt-out-numbers-doubled-last-year/article_f67ad248-b2e9-11e4-80ec-3fec00371a7d.html">reported on a statewide spike in families opting children out of mandated assessments</a>, with my county as one of the hotspots. This finding complemented prior reporting I had done on local parents organizing around opt-outs. After my reporting on the statewide opt-out spike, other education reporters across Pennsylvania sought the data I had obtained and localized the topic to their regions.</p>
<p>I conducted my analyses for that story and others using self-taught methods in Google Sheets. I also experimented with building interactive maps via Fusion Tables and regularly created my own graphics for stories using free web tools.</p>
