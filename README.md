## Newspaper lineage web scraper
A colleague and I built a web scraper that uses the Library of Congress Chronicling America database to trace the lineages of all current U.S. newspapers. We wrote the code for the scraper in Python using Selenium and exported the resulting files to R for further manipulation and analysis.

## Data-driven education reporting
<p>Prior to my graduate program, I used a data-driven approach to connect public policy to peopleâ€™s lives as an education beat reporter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>For example, as frustration over standardized testing surged nationwide, I obtained data from the state Department of Education and showed that a statewide spike in families opting children out of mandated assessments. I also showed that my county was one of the hotspots for this movement, which complemented prior reporting I had done on local parents organizing around opt-outs. After my reporting on the statewide opt-out spike, other education reporters across Pennsylvania sought the data I had obtained and covered this topic in their regions.</p>
<p>I conducted my analyses for that story and others using self-taught methods in Google Sheets. I also experimented with building interactive maps via Fusion Tables and regularly created my own charts for web stories using tools such as Infogram.</p>
