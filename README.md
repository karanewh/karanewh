# Kara Newhouse Data Journalism Portfolio
## Overview
<p>This repository includes examples of the code I have written as a data reporter at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p>I began learning to code when I started my graduate education at Philip Merrill College of Journalism in August 2020. By spring 2021, I was co-leading a team of seven data reporters on an examination of worker safety in the coronavirus pandemic, using complex datasets from ten different states, along with federal data.</p>

## Essential and Exposed: Analysis of workplace COVID-19 outbreaks
<p>Analysis of state health department records led to key findings for a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism project on worker safety during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that essential workers at places like Walmart paid the price for splintered government oversight. The 13 data findings that shaped the final story, along with their underlying code, can be seen in our <a href="https://howard-center-investigations.github.io/essential_and_exposed/osha_walmart/index.html">line-by-line fact check</a>.</p>
<p>From records acquisition to analysis to many late-night rounds of writing, revising and fact checking, I was deeply involved in every aspect of the data work on this project. I coordinated a 50-person public records campaign to obtain data on workplace COVID-19 outbreaks from state health departments. As we acquired the data, I co-led a team of seven reporters in cleaning, wrangling and analyzing it. We looked for patterns and outliers within states and focused on outbreaks at Walmart stores and distribution centers across states. We also acquired and analyzed workplace COVID-19-related complaints filed with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>
<p>Throughout these steps, I both wrote code and assisted team members in asking journalistic questions about the data, problem-solving in R and transforming their data findings into language that our reporting team and readers could digest.</p>
<p>The data analysis for this project was particularly complex, as states differed in their definitions of "workplace outbreak" across multiple variables, and some did not even use the term "outbreak." My work thus required not only coding skills and statistical knowledge but strong news judgment and ethical decisionmaking. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-caf5e31d883a18deae6cd367a5ee8978">Associated Press</a> ran the story, and it was picked up by newspapers across the country, including The Washington Post.</p>


## Newspaper lineage web scraper
<p>For a forthcoming investigative series and news app, a colleague and I built a web scraper that uses the Library of Congress' <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/">U.S. Newspaper Directory</a> to trace lineages of all current U.S. newspapers. We wrote the code for <a href ="https://github.com/karanewh/kn_data_jour_portfolio/blob/main/loc_scraper_kara.ipynb">loc_scraper_kara.ipynb</a> in Python using Selenium and exported the resulting files for further manipulation and analysis in RStudio.</p>
<p>This scraper laid the foundation for analysis of historical newspaper coverage about our topic. The full project will be published by the Howard Center for investigative Journalism in fall/winter 2021.</p>

## Data-driven education reporting
<p>Prior to my graduate education, I used a data-driven approach to connect public policy to people’s lives as an education beat reporter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>For example, as frustration over standardized testing surged nationwide, I obtained data from the state Department of Education about families opting children out of mandated assessments and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LfYrtY3hN7CudxUktHKJmYL8ume31QM/view?usp=sharing">reported on a statewide spike in this practice</a>. I found that Lancaster County was a hotspot for opt-outs — a discovery that complemented my prior reporting on local parents organizing around this issue. After my story was published, other education reporters across Pennsylvania sought the same data I had obtained and localized the topic to their regions.</p>
<p>For that story and others on the ed beat, I conducted my analyses using self-taught methods in Google Sheets. I also experimented with building interactive maps via Fusion Tables and regularly created my own graphics using free web tools. I bring my love of learning and willingness to try new techniques to every setting, whether in school or out.</p>

## About Me
<p>Kara Newhouse is an award-winning reporter based at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism who has also covered COVID-19's impact on K-12 classrooms nationwide for <a href="https://www.kqed.org/author/kdnewhouse">KQED MindShift.</a></p>
<p>She previously worked for <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/">LNP/LancasterOnline</a> in Pennsylvania, where she uncovered financial mismanagement and persistent Sunshine Act violations in Lancaster County's wealthiest school district. Her reporting prompted hundreds of taxpayers to attend public meetings and demand changes to school district operations, including a more transparent superintendent search and the restoration of elementary art and music classes.</p>
<p>Newhouse is pursuing a master’s degree in journalism with an emphasis on investigative and data journalism at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. Her undergraduate degree is from American University, where she studied anthropology.</p>
